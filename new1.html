                        YEC College students have achieved outstanding VCE results again this year. The School is very proud of their success.

Congratulations to the following students who achieved an ATAR of 99.95: Roddy Dong, Jiadong Li and Lachlan MacLennan.
                    </p>

                        We also acknowledge the 24 additional students who achieved an ATAR of 99 or more. This means that 14% of our cohort are placed in the top 1% in the State. Melbourne Grammarâ€™s strong representation at this elite level continues our long history of academic excellence.

The Class of 2022 is an accomplished group of young men, who have already gained success across multiple fields of endeavour. They have contributed widely and with genuine commitment. They have demonstrated expertise across a broad range of areas including social justice, sport, music, debating, the visual arts and more.
                        The breadth of success across VCE subjects is testament to their wide breadth of academic talents, with ten students obtaining perfect scores of 50 in one or more subjects: Business Management, English, Legal Studies, Mathematical Methods (2 students), Music Performance, Philosophy (2 students), Physical Education (2 students), and Physics.

I also wish to recognise the exceptional levels of capability and dedication demonstrated by our teaching and professional staff, and the ongoing support of family members, without which these results would not have been possible.

There are many measures of success, and an ATAR is only one of them. For many, it is simply a milestone that marks a new beginning.

                        It has been the role of the School to prepare the Class of 2022 for their journey beyond the School gates and instil in them the desire and capacity to consistently seek to improve their own lives and, importantly, that of those around them.

I have been delighted to walk alongside this remarkable group of young men during our shared time at Melbourne Grammar and wish them well in their future endeavours.
