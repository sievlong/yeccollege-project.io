                        Congratulations to:<br>

                        Selected on merit, the Awards celebrate the highest achieving students across each VCE subject in any given year.

                        “These students deserve our admiration,” says Mr Philip Grutzner, Headmaster. “While there is no doubt that an underlying talent is needed to perform exceptionally well in any subject, without sheer hard work and dedication outstanding results cannot be achieved.”
                        
                        “I was particularly pleased to note that two students – Thomas MacKinnon and Ben Solomon -commenced at Melbourne Grammar School in Prep – demonstrating the solid educational grounding that is provided at all levels of our School,” adds Mr Grutzner.
                        
                        Matthew Wong was also the 2019 Academic Head of the School and, together with Fedele De Campo and four other students, received the maximum ATAR of 99.95. You can read more about our 99.95 students here.
                        
                        This year around 300 2019 Victorian VCE students received VCE Premier’s Awards, drawn from a total cohort of around 50,000. An Award ceremony is normally held to present students with their Awards, but this was not held in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions.
